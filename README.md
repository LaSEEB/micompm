### Summary

This is work-in-progress MATLAB package for comparing simulation output.

### List of functions

* [grpoutputs] - Group outputs from multiple observations of the models to be
compared.

* [cmpoutput] - Compares one output from several runs of two or more model
implementations.

* [micomp] - Perform multiple model-independent comparisons of simulation
outputs.

* [micomp_show] - ...

* [test_assumptions] - ...

_micompm_ uses additional [helper] and [3rd party] functions.
