### Summary

_micompm_ is a [MATLAB]/[Octave] port of the original [micompr] [R] package for
comparing multivariate samples associated with different groups. It uses
principal component analysis to convert multivariate observations into a set of
linearly uncorrelated statistical measures, which are then compared using a
number of statistical methods. This technique is independent of the
distributional properties of samples and automatically selects features that
best explain their differences, avoiding manual selection of specific points or
summary statistics. The procedure is appropriate for comparing samples of time
series, images, spectrometric measures or similar multivariate observations.

Follow _micompm_'s [User Guide] to get started.
